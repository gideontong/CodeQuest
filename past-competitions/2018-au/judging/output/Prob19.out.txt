ONCE UPON A MIDNIGHT DREARY WHILE I PONDERED WEAK AND WEARY
OVER MANY A QUAINT AND CURIOUS VOLUME OF FORGOTTEN LORE
WHILE I NODDED NEARLY NAPPING SUDDENLY THERE CAME A TAPPING
AS OF SOME ONE GENTLY RAPPING RAPPING AT MY CHAMBER DOOR
TIS SOME VISITER I MUTTERED TAPPING AT MY CHAMBER DOOR
ONLY THIS AND NOTHING MORE
AH DISTINCTLY I REMEMBER IT WAS IN THE BLEAK DECEMBER
AND EACH SEPARATE DYING EMBER WROUGHT ITS GHOST UPON THE FLOOR
EAGERLY I WISHED THE MORROW VAINLY I HAD SOUGHT TO BORROW
FROM MY BOOKS SURCEASE OF SORROW SORROW FOR THE LOST LENORE
FOR THE RARE AND RADIANT MAIDEN WHOM THE ANGELS NAME LENORE
NAMELESS HERE FOR EVERMORE
AND THE SILKEN SAD UNCERTAIN RUSTLING OF EACH PURPLE CURTAIN
THRILLED ME FILLED ME WITH FANTASTIC TERRORS NEVER FELT BEFORE
SO THAT NOW TO STILL THE BEATING OF MY HEART I STOOD REPEATING
TIS SOME VISITER ENTREATING ENTRANCE AT MY CHAMBER DOOR
SOME LATE VISITER ENTREATING ENTRANCE AT MY CHAMBER DOOR
THIS IT IS AND NOTHING MORE
PRESENTLY MY SOUL GREW STRONGER HESITATING THEN NO LONGER
SIR SAID I OR MADAM TRULY YOUR FORGIVENESS I IMPLORE
BUT THE FACT IS I WAS NAPPING AND SO GENTLY YOU CAME RAPPING
AND SO FAINTLY YOU CAME TAPPING TAPPING AT MY CHAMBER DOOR
THAT I SCARCE WAS SURE I HEARD YOU HERE I OPENED WIDE THE DOOR
DARKNESS THERE AND NOTHING MORE
DEEP INTO THAT DARKNESS PEERING LONG I STOOD THERE WONDERING FEARING
DOUBTING DREAMING DREAMS NO MORTAL EVER DARED TO DREAM BEFORE
BUT THE SILENCE WAS UNBROKEN AND THE STILLNESS GAVE NO TOKEN
AND THE ONLY WORD THERE SPOKEN WAS THE WHISPERED WORD LENORE
THIS I WHISPERED AND AN ECHO MURMURED BACK THE WORD LENORE
MERELY THIS AND NOTHING MORE
BACK INTO THE CHAMBER TURNING ALL MY SOUL WITHIN ME BURNING
SOON AGAIN I HEARD A TAPPING SOMEWHAT LOUDER THAN BEFORE
SURELY SAID I SURELY THAT IS SOMETHING AT MY WINDOW LATTICE
LET ME SEE THEN WHAT THEREAT IS AND THIS MYSTERY EXPLORE
LET MY HEART BE STILL A MOMENT AND THIS MYSTERY EXPLORE
TIS THE WIND AND NOTHING MORE
OPEN HERE I FLUNG THE SHUTTER WHEN WITH MANY A FLIRT AND FLUTTER
IN THERE STEPPED A STATELY RAVEN OF THE SAINTLY DAYS OF YORE
NOT THE LEAST OBEISANCE MADE HE NOT A MINUTE STOPPED OR STAYED HE
BUT WITH MIEN OF LORD OR LADY PERCHED ABOVE MY CHAMBER DOOR
PERCHED UPON A BUST OF PALLAS JUST ABOVE MY CHAMBER DOOR
PERCHED AND SAT AND NOTHING MORE COLUMN
THEN THIS EBONY BIRD BEGUILING MY SAD FANCY INTO SMILING
BY THE GRAVE AND STERN DECORUM OF THE COUNTENANCE IT WORE
THOUGH THY CREST BE SHORN AND SHAVEN THOU I SAID ART SURE NO CRAVEN
GHASTLY GRIM AND ANCIENT RAVEN WANDERING FROM THE NIGHTLY SHORE
TELL ME WHAT THY LORDLY NAME IS ON THE NIGHTS PLUTONIAN SHORE
QUOTH THE RAVEN NEVERMORE
MUCH I MARVELLED THIS UNGAINLY FOWL TO HEAR DISCOURSE SO PLAINLY
THOUGH ITS ANSWER LITTLE MEANING LITTLE RELEVANCY BORE
FOR WE CANNOT HELP AGREEING THAT NO LIVING HUMAN BEING
EVER YET WAS BLESSED WITH SEEING BIRD ABOVE HIS CHAMBER DOOR
BIRD OR BEAST UPON THE SCULPTURED BUST ABOVE HIS CHAMBER DOOR
WITH SUCH NAME AS NEVERMORE
BUT THE RAVEN SITTING LONELY ON THE PLACID BUST SPOKE ONLY
THAT ONE WORD AS IF HIS SOUL IN THAT ONE WORD HE DID OUTPOUR
NOTHING FARTHER THEN HE UTTERED NOT A FEATHER THEN HE FLUTTERED
TILL I SCARCELY MORE THAN MUTTERED OTHER FRIENDS HAVE FLOWN BEFORE
ON THE MORROW HE WILL LEAVE ME AS MY HOPES HAVE FLOWN BEFORE
THEN THE BIRD SAID NEVERMORE
STARTLED AT THE STILLNESS BROKEN BY REPLY SO APTLY SPOKEN
DOUBTLESS SAID I WHAT IT UTTERS IS ITS ONLY STOCK AND STORE
CAUGHT FROM SOME UNHAPPY MASTER WHOM UNMERCIFUL DISASTER
FOLLOWED FAST AND FOLLOWED FASTER TILL HIS SONGS ONE BURDEN BORE
TILL THE DIRGES OF HIS HOPE THAT MELANCHOLY BURDEN BORE
OF NEVER NEVERMORE
BUT THE RAVEN STILL BEGUILING MY SAD FANCY INTO SMILING
STRAIGHT I WHEELED A CUSHIONED SEAT IN FRONT OF BIRD AND BUST AND DOOR
THEN UPON THE VELVET SINKING I BETOOK MYSELF TO LINKING
FANCY UNTO FANCY THINKING WHAT THIS OMINOUS BIRD OF YORE
WHAT THIS GRIM UNGAINLY GHASTLY GAUNT AND OMINOUS BIRD OF YORE
MEANT IN CROAKING NEVERMORE
THIS I SAT ENGAGED IN GUESSING BUT NO SYLLABLE EXPRESSING
TO THE FOWL WHOSE FIERY EYES NOW BURNED INTO MY BOSOMS CORE
THIS AND MORE I SAT DIVINING WITH MY HEAD AT EASE RECLINING
ON THE CUSHIONS VELVET LINING THAT THE LAMPLIGHT GLOATED OER
BUT WHOSE VELVETVIOLET LINING WITH THE LAMPLIGHT GLOATING OER
SHE SHALL PRESS AH NEVERMORE
THEN METHOUGHT THE AIR GREW DENSER PERFUMED FROM AN UNSEEN CENSER
SWUNG BY SERAPHIM WHOSE FOOTFALLS TINKLED ON THE TUFTED FLOOR
WRETCH I CRIED THY GOD HATH LENT THEE BY THESE ANGELS HE HATH SENT THEE
RESPITE RESPITE AND NEPENTHE FROM THY MEMORIES OF LENORE
QUAFF OH QUAFF THIS KIND NEPENTHE AND FORGET THIS LOST LENORE
QUOTH THE RAVEN NEVERMORE
PROPHET SAID I THING OF EVIL PROPHET STILL IF BIRD OR DEVIL
WHETHER TEMPTER SENT OR WHETHER TEMPEST TOSSED THEE HERE ASHORE
DESOLATE YET ALL UNDAUNTED ON THIS DESERT LAND ENCHANTED
ON THIS HOME BY HORROR HAUNTED TELL ME TRULY I IMPLORE
IS THERE IS THERE BALM IN GILEAD TELL ME TELL ME I IMPLORE
QUOTH THE RAVEN NEVERMORE
PROPHET SAID I THING OF EVIL PROPHET STILL IF BIRD OR DEVIL
BY THAT HEAVEN THAT BENDS ABOVE US BY THAT GOD WE BOTH ADORE
TELL THIS SOUL WITH SORROW LADEN IF WITHIN THE DISTANT AIDENN
IT SHALL CLASP A SAINTED MAIDEN WHOM THE ANGELS NAME LENORE
CLASP A RARE AND RADIANT MAIDEN WHOM THE ANGELS NAME LENORE
QUOTH THE RAVEN NEVERMORE
BE THAT WORD OUR SIGN OF PARTING BIRD OR FIEND I SHRIEKED UPSTARTING
GET THEE BACK INTO THE TEMPEST AND THE NIGHTS PLUTONIAN SHORE
LEAVE NO BLACK PLUME AS A TOKEN OF THAT LIE THY SOUL HATH SPOKEN
LEAVE MY LONELINESS UNBROKEN QUIT THE BUST ABOVE MY DOOR
TAKE THY BEAK FROM OUT MY HEART AND TAKE THY FORM FROM OFF MY DOOR
QUOTH THE RAVEN NEVERMORE
AND THE RAVEN NEVER FLITTING STILL IS SITTING STILL IS SITTING
ON THE PALLID BUST OF PALLAS JUST ABOVE MY CHAMBER DOOR
AND HIS EYES HAVE ALL THE SEEMING OF A DEMONS THAT IS DREAMING
AND THE LAMPLIGHT OER HIM STREAMING THROWS HIS SHADOW ON THE FLOOR
AND MY SOUL FROM OUT THAT SHADOW THAT LIES FLOATING ON THE FLOOR
SHALL BE LIFTED NEVERMORE

two roads diverged in a yellow wood
and sorry i could not travel both
and be one traveler long i stood
and looked down one as far as i could
to where it bent in the undergrowth
then took the other as just as fair
and having perhaps the better claim
because it was grassy and wanted wear
though as for that the passing there
had worn them really about the same
and both that morning equally lay
in leaves no step had trodden black
oh i kept the first for another day
yet knowing how way leads on to way
i doubted if i should ever come back
i shall be telling this with a sigh
somewhere ages and ages hence
two roads diverged in a wood and i
i took the one less traveled by
and that has made all the difference
