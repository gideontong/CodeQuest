# Code Quest

This library was created to organize and study for Lockheed Martin's [Code Quest](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/communities/codequest.html), which is an annual competition held worldwide and around the United States where students compete in order to solve programming problems.

It includes all of the past competitions as well as libraries that are to be smuggled into the competition in order to increase the speed of the completion of the programs. Code written by someone else is appropriately credited when applicable, and other GitHub contributors have been credited in the git commit log.

This library is organized by Gideon Tong, whom you can email at gideon@gideontong.com should you have any questions about the code contained therein, or to request a DMCA takedown.
