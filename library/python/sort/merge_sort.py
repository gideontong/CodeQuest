Merge sort is a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half.
If the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition (the base case). If the list has
more than one item, we split the list and recursively invoke a merge sort on both halves. Once the
two halves are sorted, the fundamental operation, called a merge, is performed.
